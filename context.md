üéÆ Puff Quest - Complete Project Overview
üìä Project Summary
Puff Quest is a Solana-based play-to-earn web application that uses AI-powered facial recognition to detect "puff" actions via webcam, rewarding users with $SMOKE tokens. It combines blockchain technology, computer vision, and gamification mechanics to create a unique "Smokernomics" ecosystem.

üéØ Core Systems Implemented
1. Authentication System (src/hooks/useSolanaAuth.ts)
Features:

Solana wallet connection (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
Web3 sign-in with Supabase authentication
Session persistence via localStorage
Automatic wallet address sync to user profiles
Auth state management with real-time listeners
Flow:

Sign authentication message ‚Üí signInWithWeb3
Create/retrieve Supabase user session
Sync wallet address to profiles table
2. Purchase & Onboarding System (src/components/play/PurchaseGate.tsx)
Vice Purchase Mechanics:

3 Device Types: Vape, Cigarette, Cigar
Price: 0.2 SOL each (Devnet SOL)
Multi-selection: Users can buy multiple devices
Blockchain verification via Edge Function
Purchase Flow:


graph TD
    A[Select Vices] --> B[Pay SOL via Wallet]
    B --> C[Transaction Sent to Solana]
    C --> D[Edge Function: purchase-vices]
    D --> E{Verify Transaction}
    E -->|Valid| F[Update Profile: vices array]
    F --> G[Initialize device_levels to Level 1]
    G --> H[Record in vice_purchases table]
    E -->|Invalid| I[Return Error]
Edge Function: purchase-vices

Verifies transaction on Solana blockchain
Validates sender, recipient (team wallet), and amount
Prevents duplicate purchases via transaction signature
Initializes device levels to 1 for purchased vices
Records purchase in vice_purchases table
3. AI Puff Detection System
Components:

MediaPipe Setup (src/lib/MediaPipeSetup.ts)
Puff Detection Hook (src/hooks/usePuffDetection.ts)
Camera Tracker UI (src/components/play/CameraTracker.tsx)
How It Works:


sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Camera
    participant MediaPipe
    participant Algorithm
    participant Database

    User->>Camera: Enable Webcam
    Camera->>MediaPipe: Stream Video Frames
    MediaPipe->>Algorithm: Extract 478 Face Landmarks
    Algorithm->>Algorithm: Analyze Mouth Metrics
    Note over Algorithm: - Mouth aspect ratio<br/>- Lip pursing<br/>- Cheek puff<br/>- Jaw open
    Algorithm->>Algorithm: Calculate Confidence Score
    alt Confidence ‚â• 90%
        Algorithm->>User: üî• PUFF DETECTED!
        Algorithm->>Database: Award $SMOKE
    else Confidence < 90%
        Algorithm->>MediaPipe: Continue Monitoring
    end
Detection Metrics:

Mouth Height/Width/Aspect Ratio
Lip Pursing (mouth corners movement)
Cheek Puff (blendshape analysis)
Jaw Open (mouth opening detection)
Sequence Score (historical pattern analysis)
Confidence Thresholds:

‚â• 90%: Puff detected (4-second cooldown)
70-89%: High confidence (visual warning)
50-69%: Medium confidence
< 50%: Low confidence
Visual Feedback:

Real-time facial landmark overlay
Color-coded confidence bar
Metric display on canvas
"üî• PUFF DETECTED!" flash animation
4. $SMOKE Token Economy (src/lib/GameEconomy.ts)
Direct $SMOKE Rewards System (recently migrated from points)

Earning Mechanics
Active Earnings (per puff):


calculatePuffSmoke(deviceLevels, globalStats, isActiveSession)
Base Formula:

baseSmoke = 10 (for Vape Level 1)
           + 15 (for Cigarette Level 1)  
           + 25 (for Cigar Level 1)
Multipliers Applied:

Device Level Multiplier: (currentLevel / 2)

Level 1: 0.5√ó
Level 3: 1.5√ó
Level 5: 2.5√ó
Early Adopter Bonus:

< 50 players: 1.2√ó
50-99 players: 1.0√ó
‚â• 100 players: Deflation kicks in
Active Session Multiplier: 2.5√ó (when tracking is on)

Deflation Factor:


if (totalPlayers >= 100) {
  deflationFactor = max(0.1, 1 - ((totalPlayers - 100) * 0.002))
}
At 100 players: 1.0√ó
At 200 players: 0.8√ó
At 550 players: 0.1√ó (maximum deflation)
Example Earnings:

Level 1 Vape (< 50 players, active session):

10 √ó 0.5 √ó 1.2 √ó 2.5 = 15 $SMOKE per puff
All 3 devices at Level 5 (< 50 players, active session):

(10 + 15 + 25) √ó 2.5 √ó 1.2 √ó 2.5 = 375 $SMOKE per puff
Passive Income (per hour):


calculatePassiveIncome(deviceLevels, globalStats, hoursSinceLastClaim)
Vape: 10 $SMOKE/hr per level (starts at Level 2)
Cigarette: 15 $SMOKE/hr per level
Cigar: 25 $SMOKE/hr per level
Capped: Maximum 24 hours of accumulation
Deflation: Same formula as active earnings
Example:

Level 5 Vape: (5 - 1) √ó 10 = 40 $SMOKE/hr
Level 5 Cigarette: (5 - 1) √ó 15 = 60 $SMOKE/hr
Level 5 Cigar: (5 - 1) √ó 25 = 100 $SMOKE/hr
Total: 200 $SMOKE/hr (before deflation)
Upgrade System
Cost Formula:


getUpgradeCost(currentLevel) = 2^(currentLevel - 2)
Upgrade Costs:

Level 1 ‚Üí 2: FREE (first upgrade)
Level 2 ‚Üí 3: 1 $SMOKE
Level 3 ‚Üí 4: 2 $SMOKE
Level 4 ‚Üí 5: 4 $SMOKE
Level 5 ‚Üí 6: 8 $SMOKE
Level 6 ‚Üí 7: 16 $SMOKE
Level 7 ‚Üí 8: 32 $SMOKE
Level 8 ‚Üí 9: 64 $SMOKE
Level 9 ‚Üí 10: 128 $SMOKE
Total cost to max level (1 ‚Üí 10): 255 $SMOKE per device

Edge Function: upgrade-device

Validates device ownership and level
Checks $SMOKE balance
Updates device_levels in profile
Deducts cost from smoke_balance
Logs transaction in smoke_transactions
Streak System

getStreakMultiplier(streakDays)
1-6 days: 1.0√ó
7-13 days: 1.1√ó
14-29 days: 1.2√ó
30+ days: 1.5√ó
(Not yet fully integrated into UI)

Token Economics
$SMOKE Distribution:

Initial Pool: 45,000,000 $SMOKE
Circulating Supply: 40,000,000 $SMOKE
Team Allocation: 5,000,000 $SMOKE
Depletion Rate (with current mechanics):

With 100 users earning ~13,935 $SMOKE/day each:
Pool lasts ~32 days
Fast depletion = FOMO mechanic (Option A chosen)
5. Session Management System (src/pages/Play.tsx)
Session Lifecycle:


stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Active: Start Tracking
    Active --> Recording: Puff Detected
    Recording --> Active: Continue
    Active --> Completed: Stop Session
    Completed --> [*]
Session Tracking:

puff_sessions table stores:
session_id (UUID)
user_id (wallet address)
started_at / ended_at timestamps
puff_count (number of puffs)
smoke_earned (total $SMOKE in session)
duration_seconds
On Puff Detection:

Insert record in puff_events table with:
Confidence score
Facial metrics (mouth height, width, aspect ratio, etc.)
$SMOKE awarded
Detection reason
Update user's smoke_balance and total_smoke_earned
Update session's puff_count and smoke_earned
Insert transaction in smoke_transactions
6. Global Stats System
Edge Function: update-global-stats

Runs periodically to calculate:

Total Players: Count of wallets with ‚â• 1 puff
Total $SMOKE Distributed: Sum of all total_smoke_earned
Rewards Pool Remaining: 45M - total distributed
Last Updated: Timestamp
Used for:

Deflation calculations
Dashboard displays
Economic balancing
7. Passive Income Automation
Edge Function: calculate-passive-income

Scheduled Task (hourly cron job):

Fetch users with Level 2+ devices
Calculate hours since last_passive_claim
Award passive $SMOKE to smoke_balance
Update last_passive_claim timestamp
Log transaction in smoke_transactions
